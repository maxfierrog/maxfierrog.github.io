It would not make sense to have a _Posts_ section in the [main page](/) without any posts, and I am too lazy to make it conditionally disappear only to never use that functionality once I make an actual post.

**Update:** I still have not added any posts, but I am in the process of writing one! It will be about the design process behind one of my projects.
