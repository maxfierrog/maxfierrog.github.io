i enter and hear hopeful tones 
from aspects of you composed; 
with restraint chosen out of many, 
allowed to exist by your hands

in another room of your house 
your words become tulip petals; 
lightly into the air you pronounce 
your voice in a violet spectrum

outside, the clouds always wander; 
in an ephemeral december window, 
your image trembles through water 
of raindrops chosen by your words

i don't spill these thoughts, i hold 
a sunday evening in crystal fixed 
refracting your luminous warmth: 
an original gift of your goodness

rivers of ice, pillars of glass, 
like water, light runs through crystal; 
thoughts travel inside your forehead: 
in my mind, to think is now to reason 
the precious movements of your will:
across the earth
    glacial penmanship, 
    beautiful writing

springs of magma, columns of light, 
deep in those channels, molten flows; 
warm blood filters through your dermis: 
on my chest, to feel is now to witness 
waves of sun washing over your skin: 
across the earth
    volcanic flows, 
    solar embrace

turbulent flames over the water,
soothing stillness hugs me fixed-
come evening, you dress me
in ever more radiant skin,
        now warm evermore:
of all the earthly pillars built from rock,
infinite is the throne in which we now lay;
    high
waterfall of light, one endless flow,
it washes through insufficient hands:
  always insufficient 
    yet now complete 
    and forever more:
we phosphoresce in our presence,
               glowing evermore:
everything shines over the water-
set ablaze and held calmly still:
