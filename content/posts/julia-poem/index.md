i enter and hear hopeful tones 
from aspects of you composed; 
with restraint chosen out of many, 
allowed to exist by your hands

in another room of your house 
your words become tulip petals; 
lightly into the air you pronounce 
your voice in a violet spectrum

outside, the clouds always wander; 
in an ephemeral december window, 
your image trembles through water 
of raindrops chosen by your words

i don't spill these thoughts, i hold 
a sunday evening in crystal fixed 
refracting your luminous warmth: 
an original gift of your goodness
