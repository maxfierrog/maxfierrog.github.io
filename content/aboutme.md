The world seems to think that the universal set can be partitioned into two subsets (a _self_ and an _other_) in reference to every person, and that their boundary is the best definition of who that person is. I disagree, as I do not think that there exists a correct way to describe a surface which effectively encapsulates (or isolates) us in our entirety. I think that we all contribute to a single collective experience which our bodies can only feel locally. When our egos collide (contact of mind, skin, or will), our experiences ache to equalize much like temperature does when very hot and cold metals touch.

I want this page to expose as much of myself as possible so that you may understand me, and so that I may understand you (insofar as your having read this allows me to understand you). To me, communion is one of the greatest joys of life, so I thank you for the chance of being understood beyond superficially.

#### Biographical facts and preliminaries

I was born in August 18th, 2003, in Houston, Texas (in the United States) but have lived the _formative_ chunk of my life in Colima, Col. (in Mexico). I am fluent and literate in English and Spanish. I like to use English to make miscellaneous statements, but I like to use Spanish to express myself.

My given name was Máximo Fierro García, but now (for non-profound reasons) it is Maximo Fierro, and I go by Max. I am the son of Eduardo Fierro Torres and Delia García Becerra, both of whom are from Mexico City. I have one sibling, María Luisa Fierro García, whom I look up to very much.

I am Mestizo, but unlike some of my peers in the United States, race has never been something I have considered relevant to my identity. I believe that my upbringing was the most consequential factor in shaping who I am. Hence, I must also acknowledge that I have had a fortunate life; my parents made sure I did not worry about financials during my childhood and early adulthood, and my family has always provided genuine love and support. I think their greatest gift was the teaching of pure love, which I understood well enough to know to pay it forward instead of back (but I do love them back, of course).

It would also be unfair not to mention the role my friends have had in my personal development. I do not know who, where, or how I would be without them, so they certainly help constitute a few biographical facts of mine. Being around them has brought me some of the greatest joys I have experienced.

#### Tendencies and ethics

At my core, I am not a very pragmatic person. As you might have been able to tell from my introduction, I quickly gravitate towards the abstract and stay there if given the chance. I rely on my body's checks and balances to realize my will and interface with the world, but I stay in my mind for the most part.

However, I listen to what my body asks of me. I make my decisions understanding that I should not expect my body to conform to my ideals, as it is limited by chemical imbalances, fatigue, the principle of locality (have you ever wished you could be in two places at once?), and other simple things with no absolute solution.

This has led me to one of my most important results -- that it is okay to believe that something is wrong, and still do it. This is not to say that I am _okay_ with the most heinous of crimes happening, but it does mean that I do not blame myself when I do not have the energy to wake up early for work. I may believe that it is the right thing to do, but I do not lose any sleep over making these kinds of decisions.

Understanding this (which took a lot of work) has allowed me to live a life free of torment from myself and has greatly impacted my ethics, especially when placed in the context of a collective _self_. Having said that, I do not grow complacent with the status quo because it is what my body asks for. I still work towards a solution, and repay all my moral debts where appropriate. I simply accept and allow myself the ebb and flow of being human.

As a result, I am also very lighthearted and generally a positive person. My mood only ever darkens for no apparent reason. When it does, I apply the same reasoning and am very open about it, saying that I am just not having a great day. With emotions and with everything, I am a person who truly believes in communication, and who is open to being wrong (because I do not know much). I do not feel challenged or in attrition when put in otherwise uncomfortable situations with others, because from my point of view, there is never anything to challenge.

#### Beauty and aesthetics

As I mentioned, my mind gravitates naturally towards the abstract, or in other words, to reducing objects to their fundamental characteristics and researching relationships between them. This is because I believe there is profound beauty within simple form. In this regard, I have allowed my aesthetics to be a guide when it comes to what I do with my time.

This appreciation often finds itself at odds with the intent of having a tangible impact on my surroundings. However, even within functional processes, I have been able to draw abstract parallels with pure forms, which I find very stimulating. This has allowed me to blur the lines between what I do out of need, good, and affection.

I have indeed cultivated the belief that form and function are not very different, and that the way they present themselves to us is defined by our aesthetics. I believe that function can be synthesized through aesthetics by finding motivation in the beauty of form. This is to say that we can sometimes notice patterns first, and only then come up with useful functionality to fit into them. This differs from the usual understanding of function, where it is believed that people should train to understand it, and then force reality to conform to the structure it would otherwise present itself in.

I think that individuals are capable of producing novel results if their aesthetics are sufficiently developed, and if they are given enough time to follow the drive that is born therefrom. At least for myself, coming up with functionality to inject into beautiful patterns is something deeply personal. I also enjoy it the other way around; noticing patterns naturally arise from desired functionality (and then creating solutions accordingly) is, in my opinion, the beauty of modern problem solving.
