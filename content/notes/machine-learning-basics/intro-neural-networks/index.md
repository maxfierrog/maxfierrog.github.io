Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Key Concepts

- **Input Layer**: Receives the raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform the data
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights between connections through a process called training.
