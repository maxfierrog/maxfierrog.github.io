If you are here to learn about me as a collaborator, you might be interested in [my resume](/resume/). Otherwise, you can look at my favorite [music collections](/music/). Sometimes I also write things for "fun" and publish them here. If you find something interesting or useful, you should check your water supply for heavy metals.
