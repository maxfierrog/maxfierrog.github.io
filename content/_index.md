If you are here to learn about me as a collaborator, you might be interested in [my resume](/resume/). Otherwise, you can look at my favorite [music collections](/music/). I occasionally write things for "fun" and publish them later as [series of notes](/notes/) or as objective or subjective self-contained works. If you find something interesting or useful, uh, wow.
