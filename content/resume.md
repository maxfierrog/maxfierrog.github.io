I am currently completing the fourth semester of my undergraduate studies, and have found interests in mathematics, computer science, leadership, and low-level programming. I also work in UC Berkeley IT and have recently gotten involved with a research group exploring computational game theory, advised by [Dr. Dan Garcia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/?_ga=2.162746047.2021628792.1679746835-1016432887.1673162780).

# üõ†Ô∏è Professional History

**[Meta](https://about.meta.com/)** <span style="float:right;"> Menlo Park, CA </span> \
**_Software Engineer Intern_** <span style="float:right;"> May 2023 - Aug 2023 </span>

This has not happened yet, but I am hoping to be matched with a team working in systems or infrastructure. Last time I worked on iOS, and that was not incredibly fun for me.

**[UC Berkeley SAIT](https://technology.berkeley.edu/SAIT)** <span style="float:right;"> Berkeley, CA </span> \
**_Lead Endpoint Engineer_** <span style="float:right;"> Mar 2022 - Now </span>

I lead a team responsible for the development of open-ended IT initiatives in the department of Student Affairs and the management of all workstations and devices used by UC Berkeley Student Affairs groups. Some of the things we have achieved in my time here have been:

* Built infrastructure for and provided 60 iPads to teachers in the [ECE Program](https://ece.berkeley.edu/).
* Created 2 interviewing stations free for all UC Berkeley students at the [Career Center](https://career.berkeley.edu/).
* Set up an accessible station for [CalDining](https://caldining.berkeley.edu/) employees with low tech and English literacy.
* Helped [Cal Esports](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/programs-events/esports/) do a drop-in replacement of 55 gaming PCs' hardware and software. 

In addition to these collective achievements, in my specific capacity as team lead I have:

* Conducted 2 hiring panels for the [Endpoint Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_sCM0PM0WK7ghG6OPg30eWQ8d081LPXzWVUMnY5pMc/edit) position.
* Advised CIO and senior IT leaders as part of the [Student Technology Council](https://stc.berkeley.edu/).
* [Contributed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JcIjnEDlngqoJxj0I6JEmAplYlQL42iv/view?usp=sharing) to the OneIT initiative instantiating more student programs in Berkeley IT.

**[Meta](https://about.meta.com/)** <span style="float:right;"> Menlo Park, CA </span> \
**_MetaU Engineering Intern_** <span style="float:right;"> Jun 2022 - Aug 2022 </span>

I was taught large-scale application design and developed my own project with the guidance of two (incredibly didactic and supportive) software engineers. While I barely touched Meta's codebase (by the program's design), I did learn a lot about the work of the team I was placed into, which helped [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) transfer and archive data.

The main project I worked on was an iOS task-based project management application I called [Process](https://github.com/maxfierrog/process) whose main feature was a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of task-to-task dependencies (as opposed to just a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) or list) on a recursive user interface. It is built on a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)-d backend and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) frontend (in hindsight, should have used [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)'s graph DB instead).

**[UC Berkeley SAIT](https://technology.berkeley.edu/SAIT)** <span style="float:right;"> Berkeley, CA </span> \
**_Student Technology Consultant_** <span style="float:right;"> Aug 2021 - Mar 2022 </span>

I provided frontline hardware and software assistance to students, and contributed to our standardized procedures which are still used by the 20+ member [Student Helpdesk](https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/techsupport) team. This was overall incredibly varying work, and I learned a lot about customer service and got to be very scrappy (in a careful way). Students can sometimes get their computers intot truly _"wow"_ states.

**[Jolibee](https://www.jollibeefoods.com/)** <span style="float:right;"> San Diego, CA </span> \
**_Crew Member_** <span style="float:right;"> Mar 2021 - Jun 2021 </span>

No meal is complete without the bread, and no CV is complete without fast food experience. With the help of my comrades, I served food at up to 3 orders per minute. I worked 40 hour weeks while being a full-time high school student, which was exhausting. This is the hardest work I have done in my life, including being a Berkeley student (but excluding 40 degree Celsius soccer practices in 2nd grade).

# ü§ù Afiliations

**[GamesCrafters](http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/)** <span style="float:right;"> Jan 2023 - Now </span> \
_Computational game theory research and development group._

This group researches methods for strongly solving abstract strategy games and develops the infrastructure to do it and to make results available through a few types of interfaces. Currently I am contributing to:

* Solving [Five Field Kono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Field_Kono).
* A [lookup table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookup_table) based database compression scheme.
* A [model based](http://mattmahoney.net/dc/mmahoney00.pdf) database compression scheme (memorizing using neural nets).
* Prepping for [CalDay](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/events/cal-day/)!

**[FRC Team #6348](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/6348)** <span style="float:right;"> Sep 2019 - Aug 2022 </span> \
_High school robotics and STEM group from Colima, Mexico._

This is a First Robotics Competition group from my high shcool. It is very close to my heart, because me and my closest friends put in a lot of work for the team. While I still occasionally help out with mentoring, my active involvement has largely ceased because I have gotten increasingly busy. Here are the roles I have held:

* As an **official mentor** I gave professional and acadmic guidance to the team.
* As **head of the Design Division** I coordinated the design of an award-winning robot.
* As a **driver** I participated in competitions and got to crash our robots a few times.
* As a **member** I made a lot of friends who went on to become incredible individuals.
