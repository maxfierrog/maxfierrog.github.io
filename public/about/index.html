        <h1>Personal Overview</h1>

    </header><p>It is easy to suppose that the world can be partitioned into what is <em>you</em> and <em>not you</em> in reference to every person, and that their observable boundary is the best definition of who a person is. This is a recurring thought for me, and I do not think that there exists a correct way to describe a surface which effectively encapsulates (or isolates) us in our entirety. I think we interface with each other in a collective distribution, with each discernible mode being a single person.</p>
<p>Framing things that way, getting to know another person is in many ways an impactful act. Even if a person never knows that information about them is spreading, reality is certainly different due to them, and the person or systems to whom it spread will carry a bit of the information emitter&rsquo;s existence together with their own.</p>
<p>There are some who hate this. They wish to have control over every single <code>bit</code> of information encoding their existence, because it belongs to them. I appreciate their feelings, and wish to support them to the best of my ability. My opinion diverges, as I think that things would turn out better if we all adopted the &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; of sharing information (fairly and safely).</p>
<h2 id="biographical-preliminaries">Biographical preliminaries</h2>
<p>I was born in August 18th, 2003, in Houston, Texas (in the United States) but have lived the formative chunk of my life in Colima, Colima (in Mexico). I am fluent and literate in English and Spanish. My English dialect changes depending on my environment, but my Spanish is mostly constant.</p>
<p>My given name was Máximo Fierro García, but now (for non-profound reasons) it is Maximo Fierro, and I go by Max. I am the son of Eduardo Fierro Torres and Delia García Becerra, both of whom are from Mexico City. I have one sibling, María Luisa Fierro García, whom I look up to very much.</p>
<p>I am Mestizo, but race has never been something I have considered relevant to my identity. I believe that my upbringing was the most consequential factor in shaping who I am. Hence, I must also acknowledge that I have had a fortunate life; my parents made sure I did not worry about financing during my childhood and early adulthood, and my family has always provided genuine love and support. I think their greatest gift was the teaching of pure love, which I understood well enough to know to pay it forward instead of back (but I do love them back, of course).</p>
<p>It would also be unfair not to mention the role my friends have had in my life. I do not know who, where, or how I would be without them, so they themselves are biographical facts of mine. Knowing they exist is enough to make me happy.</p>
<h2 id="tendencies-and-ethics">Tendencies and ethics</h2>
<p>At my core, I am not a very pragmatic person. As you might have been able to tell from my introduction, I quickly gravitate towards the abstract and stay there if given the chance. I rely on my body&rsquo;s checks and balances to realize my will and interface with the world, but I &ldquo;stay&rdquo; in my mind for the most part.</p>
<p>However, I listen to what my body asks of me. I make my decisions understanding that I should not expect my body to conform to my ideals, as it is limited by chemical imbalances, fatigue, the principle of locality (have you ever wished you could be in two places at once?), and other simple yet intractable problems.</p>
<p>I am comfortable with the fact that we sometimes cannot avoid doing things which we believe to be wrong; in my eyes, contradiction is part of being human. This is not to say that I am simply okay with the most heinous of crimes happening, but it does mean that I do not blame myself when my imperfect self does not have sufficient resources to realize whatever variant of perfection I had previously conceived.</p>
<p>Understanding this (which took a lot of work) has allowed me to live a life free of torment from myself and has greatly impacted my ethics, especially when placed in the context of a collective. Having said that, I do not grow complacent with the status quo because it is what my body asks for. I still work towards a solution, and repay all my moral debts where appropriate. I simply accept and allow myself the ebb and flow of being human, and factor in the possibility of imperfection into my practice of existence.</p>
<p>As a result, I am also very lighthearted and generally a positive person. My mood only ever darkens for no apparent reason (science still cannot answer why I woke up feeling down today). When it does, I apply the same reasoning and am very open about it, saying that I am just not having a great day. With emotions and with everything, I am a person who truly believes in communication. Generally, I do not feel challenged or in attrition when put in otherwise uncomfortable situations with others, because from my point of view, there is never anything to challenge.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-beauty">Relationship with beauty</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, my mind gravitates towards the abstract. This is because to me there is profound beauty in simple form. With regards to this, I have allowed my aesthetics to be a guide when it comes to what I do with my time; the personification of my biological mechanism optimizes for the beauty it perceives, which is an objective it can only &ldquo;clarify,&rdquo; and certainly not &ldquo;define&rdquo; into abundance.</p>
<p>This appreciation often finds itself at odds with the intent of having a tangible impact on my surroundings. However, even within functional processes, I have been able to draw abstract parallels with pure forms, which I find very stimulating. This has allowed me to blur the lines between what I do out of need, good, and affection.</p>
<p>I am not sure how relevant it is to my representations of &ldquo;form&rdquo; and &ldquo;function,&rdquo; but an architect famously said that all beautiful buildings have function but that the converse is false &ndash; hence, the form something takes should mold to its function. In confused disagreement, I have accepted the belief that form and function are not very different, and that the way they both present themselves to us is via our aesthetics. I believe that function can be synthesized by finding motivation in the beauty of form. This is to say that we can sometimes notice patterns first, and only then come up with useful functionality to &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into them. This differs from the usual understanding of function, where it is believed that people should train to understand it, and then force reality to conform to the structure it would otherwise present itself in. This is what design means to me at an atomic level; a single-step process of composing beautiful forms into another one that is both beautiful and functional, not the multi-step procedure of ascertaining desired function and then formally wrapping it.</p>
<p>With these ramblings out of the way, it will not come as a surprise that I think that individuals are capable of producing novel results if their aesthetics are sufficiently developed, and if they are given enough resources to follow the drive that is very naturally born therefrom. At least in my case, design is something very personal, and in many regards synonymous to problem-solving. Perhaps my cloudy thesis (if there is one at all) is that the concepts in discussion exist as a homogenous mixture in my mind, and that an attempt to semantically gerrymander them apart to explain their mixture in terms of its diluted components seems generally futile and needless.</p>
