    </header><p>When I meet new people, they usually expect me to be different to how I actually am. I thought that would be a good first thing to know about me; apparently this book got the wrong cover.</p>
<p>I tried to start writing about myself, but I gave up. It is really hard. So here is what I can do instead. I will provide some basic facts about me first. I will then make my job easier by giving myself a few prompts.</p>
<p>One last thing before we start. This seems very silly to me as well, to be writing all of this. I do it because it is hard to justify my work and thinking being publically accessible without any kind of context as to who produced all of it. So here is some information about me.</p>
<h2 id="biographical-facts">Biographical Facts</h2>
<p>I was born in August 18th, 2003, in Houston, Texas (in the United States) but have lived the formative chunk of my life in Colima, Colima (in Mexico). I am fluent and literate in English and Spanish.</p>
<p>My given name was Máximo Fierro García, but now (for non-profound reasons) it is Maximo Fierro, and I go by Max. I am the son of Eduardo Fierro Torres and Delia García Becerra, both of whom are from Mexico City. I have one sibling, María Luisa Fierro García, whom I look up to very much.</p>
<p>I am Mestizo, but race has never been something I have considered relevant to my identity. I believe that my upbringing was the most consequential factor in shaping who I am. Hence, I must also acknowledge that I have had a fortunate life; my parents made sure I did not worry about any basic needs during my childhood and early adulthood, and my family has always provided pure love and support.</p>
<h2 id="random-prompts">Random Prompts</h2>
<h3 id="what-value-or-belief-would-you-defend-to-the-end">What value or belief would you defend to the end?</h3>
<p>Truth exists. I think every question has one correct answer, even if difficult or impossible to express.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-imagine-your-true-self-what-single-adjective-captures-it">When you imagine your “true self,” what single adjective captures it?</h3>
<p>Natural.</p>
<h3 id="which-ideal-would-you-choose-over-comfort-or-convenience">Which ideal would you choose over comfort or convenience?</h3>
<p>To satisfy curiosity, both in myself and others.</p>
<h3 id="what-attribute-of-mine-would-you-never-trade">What attribute of mine would you never trade?</h3>
<p>The ability to think clearly. I have always felt like my thoughts are transparent and tractable. I only learned that this is different for each person fairly late in life, so I feel very fortunate for it.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-essence-of-your-closest-relationships">What is the essence of your closest relationships?</h3>
<p>The gifts of time and love.</p>
<h3 id="which-quality-do-you-most-hope-others-see-when-they-think-of-you">Which quality do you most hope others see when they think of you?</h3>
<p>I want to be inspiring to others, and be seen to have excellent character.</p>
<h3 id="what-best-describes-the-spirit-you-bring-into-each-new-day">What best describes the spirit you bring into each new day?</h3>
<p>Honestly, lethargy.</p>
<h3 id="what-question-would-you-ask-someone-to-get-to-know-them-better">What question would you ask someone to get to know them better?</h3>
<p>What question would you ask someone to get to know them better?</p>
