I disagree. I do not think that there exists a correct way to describe a surface which effectively encapsulates (or isolates) us in our entirety. I think that we all contribute to a single collective experience which we interface with individually. Our experiences ache to equalize much like temperature does when very hot and cold metals touch.\nI want this page to expose as much of myself as possible so that we both have the same idea of who I am, in order to become more similar with each other. Communion is one of the greatest joys of life, so I thank you for the chance of being understood beyond superficially.\nBiographical facts and preliminaries I was born in August 18th, 2003, in Houston, Texas (in the United States) but have lived the formative chunk of my life in Colima, Col. (in Mexico). I am fluent and literate in English and Spanish. I like to use English to make miscellaneous statements, but I like to use Spanish to express myself.\nMy given name was Máximo Fierro García, but now (for non-profound reasons) it is Maximo Fierro, and I go by Max. I am the son of Eduardo Fierro Torres and Delia García Becerra, both of whom are from Mexico City. I have one sibling, María Luisa Fierro García, whom I look up to very much.\nI am Mestizo, but race has never been something I have considered relevant to my identity. I believe that my upbringing was the most consequential factor in shaping who I am. Hence, I must also acknowledge that I have had a fortunate life; my parents made sure I did not worry about financing during my childhood and early adulthood, and my family has always provided genuine love and support. I think their greatest gift was the teaching of pure love, which I understood well enough to know to pay it forward instead of back (but I do love them back, of course).\nIt would also be unfair not to mention the role my friends have had in my personal development. I do not know who, where, or how I would be without them, so they certainly help constitute a few biographical facts of mine. Being around them has brought me some of the greatest joys I have experienced.\nTendencies and ethics At my core, I am not a very pragmatic person. As you might have been able to tell from my introduction, I quickly gravitate towards the abstract and stay there if given the chance. I rely on my body’s checks and balances to realize my will and interface with the world, but I “stay” in my mind for the most part.\nHowever, I listen to what my body asks of me. I make my decisions understanding that I should not expect my body to conform to my ideals, as it is limited by chemical imbalances, fatigue, the principle of locality (have you ever wished you could be in two places at once?), and other simple things with no absolute solution.\nI am comfortable with the fact that we sometimes cannot avoid doing things which we believe to be wrong; in my eyes, contradiction is human to an extent. This is not to say that I am simply okay with the most heinous of crimes happening, but it does mean that I do not blame myself when my imperfect self does not have sufficient resources to bring whatever variant of perfection I had previously conceived into existence.\nUnderstanding this (which took a lot of work) has allowed me to live a life free of torment from myself and has greatly impacted my ethics, especially when placed in the context of a collective self. Having said that, I do not grow complacent with the status quo because it is what my body asks for. I still work towards a solution, and repay all my moral debts where appropriate. I simply accept and allow myself the ebb and flow of being human, and factor in the possibility of imperfection into my practice of existence.\nAs a result, I am also very lighthearted and generally a positive person. My mood only ever darkens for no apparent reason (science still cannot answer why I woke up feeling down today). When it does, I apply the same reasoning and am very open about it, saying that I am just not having a great day. With emotions and with everything, I am a person who truly believes in communication, and who is open to being wrong (because I do not know much). I do not feel challenged or in attrition when put in otherwise uncomfortable situations with others, because from my point of view, there is never anything to challenge.\nBeauty and aesthetics As I mentioned, my mind gravitates naturally towards the abstract, or in other words, to reducing objects to their fundamental characteristics and researching relationships between them. This is because I believe there is profound beauty within simple form. In this regard, I have allowed my aesthetics to be a guide when it comes to what I do with my time.\nThis appreciation often finds itself at odds with the intent of having a tangible impact on my surroundings. However, even within functional processes, I have been able to draw abstract parallels with pure forms, which I find very stimulating. This has allowed me to blur the lines between what I do out of need, good, and affection.\nI have indeed cultivated the belief that form and function are not very different, and that the way they present themselves to us is defined by our aesthetics. I believe that function can be synthesized through our aesthetics by finding motivation in the beauty of form. This is to say that we can sometimes notice patterns first, and only then come up with useful functionality to fit into them. This differs from the usual understanding of function, where it is believed that people should train to understand it, and then force reality to conform to the structure it would otherwise present itself in.\nI think that individuals are capable of producing novel results if their aesthetics are sufficiently developed, and if they are given enough time to follow the drive that is born therefrom. At least for myself, coming up with functionality to inject into beautiful patterns is something deeply personal. I also enjoy it the other way around; noticing patterns naturally arise from desired functionality (and then creating solutions accordingly) is, in my opinion, the beauty of modern problem solving.\n","wordCount":"1125","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-03-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-03-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Max Fierro"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.maxfierro.me/posts/intro/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Max Fierro","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.maxfierro.me/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/ accesskey=h title="Max Fierro (Alt + H)"><img src=https://www.maxfierro.me/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Max Fierro</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/archive title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/search title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://www.maxfierro.me/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Personal Overview</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2023-03-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 23, 2023</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1125 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Max Fierro&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/maxfierrog/maxfierrog.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/intro.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#biographical-facts-and-preliminaries aria-label="Biographical facts and preliminaries">Biographical facts and preliminaries</a></li><li><a href=#tendencies-and-ethics aria-label="Tendencies and ethics">Tendencies and ethics</a></li><li><a href=#beauty-and-aesthetics aria-label="Beauty and aesthetics">Beauty and aesthetics</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>The world thinks it can be cut into two subsets (a <em>self</em> and an <em>other</em>) in reference to every person, and that the boundary between them is the best definition of who that person is.
