I also work in UC Berkeley IT and am involved with an applied research group exploring computational game theory, advised by Dr. Dan Garcia.\nüéì Academic History University of California, Berkeley B.A. Computer Science, minor in Mathematics - In progress\nFinding abstract overlaps at the intersection of these fields makes the essence of mathematics tangible in a form that does not underplay its purity, which allows practical applications to remain faithful to the beauty of fundamental objects.\nCourses‚Ä¶ CS 61A ‚Äì Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs CS 61B ‚Äì Data Structures and Algorithms CS 61C ‚Äì Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures) CS 70 ‚Äì Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory CS 170 ‚Äì Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems CS 186 ‚Äì Introduction to Database Systems MATH 1A ‚Äì Calculus I MATH 1B ‚Äì Calculus II MATH 54 ‚Äì Linear Algebra and Differential Equations üõ†Ô∏è Professional History Software Engineer Intern @ Meta Menlo Park, CA ‚Äì May 2023 to Aug 2023\nDetails‚Ä¶ I contributed to the Meta Ads platform. Specifically, I worked on a pre-alpha feature related to ad bidding which will help advertisers express granular adjustments to the value they attribute to different audiences based on various user dimensions, and which will be a part of the Ads Manager tool once released. This was full-stack product work. MetaU Engineering Intern @ Meta Menlo Park, CA ‚Äì Jun 2022 to Aug 2022\nDetails‚Ä¶ I was taught large-scale application design and developed my own project with the guidance of two (incredibly didactic and supportive) software engineers. While I barely touched Meta‚Äôs codebase (by the program‚Äôs design), I did learn a lot about the work of the team I was placed into, which helped WhatsApp transfer and archive data.\nThe main project I worked on was an iOS task-based project management application I called Process whose main feature was a directed acyclic graph of task-to-task dependencies (as opposed to just a tree or list) on a recursive user interface. It is built on a Firebase-d backend and SwiftUI frontend (in hindsight, should have used Neo4j‚Äôs graph DB instead).\nLead Endpoint Engineer @ UC Berkeley SAIT Berkeley, CA ‚Äì Mar 2022 to now\nDetails‚Ä¶ I lead a team responsible for the development of open-ended IT initiatives in the department of Student Affairs and the management of all workstations and devices used by UC Berkeley Student Affairs groups. Some of the things we have achieved in my time here have been:\nBuilt infrastructure for and provided 60 iPads to teachers in the ECE Program. Created 2 interviewing stations free for all UC Berkeley students at the Career Center. Set up an accessible station for CalDining employees with low tech and English literacy. Helped Cal Esports do a drop-in replacement of 55 gaming PCs‚Äô hardware and software. In addition to these collective achievements, in my specific capacity as team lead I have:\nConducted 3 successful hiring panels for the Endpoint Engineer position. Advised CIO Jenn Stringer and senior IT leaders as part of the Student Technology Council. Contributed to the OneIT initiative instantiating more student programs in Berkeley IT. Student Technology Consultant @ UC Berkeley SAIT Berkeley, CA ‚Äì Aug 2021 to Mar 2022\nDetails‚Ä¶ I provided frontline hardware and software assistance to students, and contributed to our standardized procedures which are still used by the 20+ member Student Helpdesk team. This was overall incredibly varying work, and I learned a lot about customer service and got to be very scrappy (in a careful way). Students can sometimes get their computers into truly ‚Äúwow‚Äù states. Crew Member @ Jolibee San Diego, CA ‚Äì Mar 2021 to Jun 2021\nDetails‚Ä¶ No meal is complete without the bread, and no CV is complete without fast food experience. With the help of my comrades, I served food at up to 3 orders per minute. I worked 40 hour weeks while being a full-time high school student, which was exhausting. This is the hardest work I have done in my life, including being a Berkeley student (but excluding 40 degree Celsius soccer practices in 2nd grade). ü§ù Afiliations R\u0026D group GamesCrafters Berkeley, CA ‚Äì Jan 2023 to now\nWe research computational methods for strongly solving abstract strategy games (and make the solution sets available through a few types of interfaces). I am personally interested in the computational modelling of coalitional games, and in developing infrastructure to solve this type of game generically across player count.\nThings I am working on‚Ä¶ Creating a re-architected version of GamesmanClassic, the group‚Äôs seminal project, in Rust. Modelling N-player transferrable-utility coalitional games in cases of complete information and turn-based play with the objective of computing their strong solution sets. An ACID-compliant and more performant re-implementation of the database engine we use to store our solution sets, which will provide the needed infrastructure to implement‚Ä¶ A lookup table based database compression scheme. Parallelized solving algorithms. Finished projects I have contributed to‚Ä¶ Solving Five Field Kono (you can play against the solution here). Outreach during CalDay 2023! FIRST Robotics Team #6348 Colima, Mexico ‚Äì Sep 2019 to Aug 2022\nThis is the FIRST Robotics Competition group from one of the high schools I went to. It is very close to my heart, because me and my closest friends put in a lot of work for the team. While I still occasionally help out with mentoring, my active involvement has largely ceased because I have gotten increasingly busy. Here are the roles I have held:\nAs an official mentor I gave professional and academic guidance to the team. As head of the Design Division I coordinated the design of an award-winning robot. As a driver I participated in competitions and got to crash our robots a few times. As a member I made a lot of friends who went on to become incredible individuals. üöÄ Skills GPPLs I know \u0026\u0026 love I can learn a programming language in about a week; if you ask me to make something great though, I will pick one of these:\nPython Java Rust C/C++ Technical Toolchain A lot of the work I have done has been enabled by different technologies, and this is some of what I have picked up along the way:\nGeneral purpose scripting (Bash, PowerShell, ActionScript) Workstation and device management (BigFix, MDM systems, Active Directory) UNIX system administration Git and Mercurial workflows SwiftUI React General Aptitudes Here are a few activities I am skilled at doing because I fundamentally enjoy them:\nOrganizational work (leadership, coordination, advising, etc.) Written and verbal communication Designing software systems Programming in Rust
