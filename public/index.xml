      <description>Our surroundings seem to implicitly suggest that the universal set can be partitioned into two subsets (a self and an other) in reference to every person, and that their boundary is the best definition of who that person is.
I do not subscribe to this belief, as I do not think that there exists a correct way to describe a manifold which effectively encapsulates (or isolates) us in our entirety. I think that we all contribute to a single collective experience which our bodies can only feel locally.</description>
