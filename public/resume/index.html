<p>I am a third-year undergraduate and have found interests in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. I am especially interested in game theory, multiagent systems, and systems programming. I also work in UC Berkeley IT and am involved with an applied research group exploring computational game theory, advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/">Prof. Garcia</a>.</p>

  <p>I contributed to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads">Meta Ads</a> platform. Specifically, I worked on a pre-alpha feature related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding">ad bidding</a> which will help advertisers express granular adjustments to the value they attribute to different audiences based on various user dimensions, and which will be a part of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager">Ads Manager tool</a> once released. This was full-stack product work.</p>

  <p>I was taught large-scale application design and developed my own project with the guidance of two (incredibly didactic and supportive) software engineers. While I barely touched Meta&rsquo;s codebase (by the program&rsquo;s design), I did learn a lot about the work of the team I was placed into, which helped <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> transfer and archive data.</p>
<p>The main project I worked on was an iOS task-based project management application I called <a href="https://github.com/maxfierrog/process">Process</a> whose main feature was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> of task-to-task dependencies (as opposed to just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree</a> or list) on a recursive user interface. It is built on a <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>-d backend and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> frontend (in hindsight, should have used <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>&rsquo;s graph DB instead).</p>

  <p>I led a team responsible for the development of open-ended IT initiatives in the department of Student Affairs and the management of all workstations and devices used by UC Berkeley Student Affairs groups. Here are some of the things we achieved together during my time there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built infrastructure for and provided 60 iPads to teachers in the <a href="https://ece.berkeley.edu/">ECE Program</a>.</li>
<li>Created 2 interviewing stations free for all UC Berkeley students at the <a href="https://career.berkeley.edu/">Career Center</a>.</li>
<li>Set up an accessible station for <a href="https://caldining.berkeley.edu/">CalDining</a> employees with low tech and English literacy.</li>
<li>Helped <a href="https://recsports.berkeley.edu/programs-events/esports/">Cal Esports</a> do a drop-in replacement of 55 gaming PCs&rsquo; hardware and software.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these collective achievements, in my specific capacity as team lead I was able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct 4 successful hiring panels for positions on my team (including my own).</li>
<li>Advise ex-CIO Jenn Stringer and IT leadership as part of the <a href="https://stc.berkeley.edu/">Student Technology Council</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JcIjnEDlngqoJxj0I6JEmAplYlQL42iv/view?usp=sharing">Contribute</a> to the OneIT initiative instantiating more student programs in Berkeley IT.</li>

  <p>I provided frontline hardware and software assistance to students, and contributed to our standardized procedures which are still used by the 20+ member <a href="https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/techsupport">Student Helpdesk</a> team. This was overall incredibly varying work, and I learned a lot about customer service and got to be very scrappy (in a careful way). Students can sometimes get their computers into truly <em>&ldquo;wow&rdquo;</em> states.</p>

  <p>No meal is complete without the bread, and no CV is complete without fast food experience. With the help of my comrades, I served food at up to 3 orders per minute. I worked 40 hour weeks while being a full-time high school student, which was exhausting. This is the hardest work I have done in my life, including being a Berkeley student (but excluding 40 degree Celsius soccer practices in 2nd grade).</p>

  <p>We research computational methods for strongly solving abstract strategy games (and make the solution sets available through a few types of interfaces). I am personally interested in the computational modelling of coalitional games, and in developing infrastructure for finding &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; for them generically.</p>

<li>Expanding the game modelling and solving system I authored, <a href="https://github.com/GamesCrafters/GamesmanNova">GamesmanNova</a>.</li>

<li>An optimized reformulation of the database engine we use to store our solution sets, utilizing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree">LSM-tree</a>. This will provide the infrastructure needed to:
<ul>
<li>Overcome the bottleneck of virtual memory usage while solving large games.</li>

  <p>This is the FIRST Robotics Competition group from one of the high schools I went to. It is very close to my heart, because me and my closest friends put in a lot of work for the team. While I still occasionally help out with mentoring, my active involvement has largely ceased because I have gotten increasingly busy. Here are the roles I have held:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an <strong>official mentor</strong> I gave professional and academic guidance to the team.</li>
<li>As <strong>head of the Design Division</strong> I coordinated the design of an award-winning robot.</li>
<li>As a <strong>driver</strong> I participated in competitions and got to crash our robots a few times.</li>
<li>As a <strong>member</strong> I made a lot of friends who went on to become incredible individuals.</li>
</ul>
