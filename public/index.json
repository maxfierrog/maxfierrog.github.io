I believe that my upbringing was the most consequential factor in shaping who I am. Hence, I must also acknowledge that I have had a fortunate life; my parents made sure I did not worry about financing during my childhood and early adulthood, and my family has always provided genuine love and support. I think their greatest gift was the teaching of pure love, which I understood well enough to know to pay it forward instead of back (but I do love them back, of course).\nIt would also be unfair not to mention the role my friends have had in my personal development.

As you might have been able to tell from my introduction, I quickly gravitate towards the abstract and stay there if given the chance.

I make my decisions understanding that I should not expect my body to conform to my ideals, as it is limited by chemical imbalances, fatigue, the principle of locality (have you ever wished you could be in two places at once?), and other simple things with no absolute solution.\nI am comfortable with the fact that we sometimes cannot avoid doing things which we believe to be wrong; in my eyes, contradiction is human to an extent. This is not to say that I am simply okay with the most heinous of crimes happening, but it does mean that I do not blame myself when my imperfect self does not have sufficient resources to bring whatever variant of perfection I had previously conceived into existence.\nUnderstanding this (which took a lot of work) has allowed me to live a life free of torment from myself and has greatly impacted my ethics, especially when placed in the context of a collective self. Having said that, I do not grow complacent with the status quo because it is what my body asks for. I still work towards a solution, and repay all my moral debts where appropriate. I simply accept and allow myself the ebb and flow of being human, and factor in the possibility of imperfection into my practice of existence.\nAs a result, I am also very lighthearted and generally a positive person. My mood only ever darkens for no apparent reason (science still cannot answer why I woke up feeling down today). When it does, I apply the same reasoning and am very open about it, saying that I am just not having a great day. With emotions and with everything, I am a person who truly believes in communication, and who is open to being wrong (because I do not know much). I do not feel challenged or in attrition when put in otherwise uncomfortable situations with others, because from my point of view, there is never anything to challenge.\nBeauty and aesthetics As I mentioned, my mind gravitates naturally towards the abstract, or in other words, to reducing objects to their fundamental characteristics and researching relationships between them. This is because I believe there is profound beauty within simple form. In this regard, I have allowed my aesthetics to be a guide when it comes to what I do with my time.\nThis appreciation often finds itself at odds with the intent of having a tangible impact on my surroundings. However, even within functional processes, I have been able to draw abstract parallels with pure forms, which I find very stimulating. This has allowed me to blur the lines between what I do out of need, good, and affection.\nI have indeed cultivated the belief that form and function are not very different, and that the way they present themselves to us is defined by our aesthetics. I believe that function can be synthesized through our aesthetics by finding motivation in the beauty of form. This is to say that we can sometimes notice patterns first, and only then come up with useful functionality to fit into them. This differs from the usual understanding of function, where it is believed that people should train to understand it, and then force reality to conform to the structure it would otherwise present itself in.\nI think that individuals are capable of producing novel results if their aesthetics are sufficiently developed, and if they are given enough time to follow the drive that is born therefrom. At least for myself, coming up with functionality to inject into beautiful patterns is something deeply personal.
